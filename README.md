## Project Description
The project requires 3 enhancements of artifacts from the software engineering program at Southern New Hampshire University
The artifacts chosen must be enhanced to meet: 
1. Software Engineering & Design
2. Data Structures & Algorithms
3. Databases

Two artifacts were chosen to perform these enhancements:
1. Binary Search Tree conversion into an AVL self-balancing tree with added user functionality
2. Animal Shelter Dashboard using MongoDB and Python script conversion to SQLite

## ENHANCEMENT ONE
This enhancement takes the original Binary Search Tree program, which is designed to load courses from a 
.csv file and push them into a binary search tree data structure (this makes search time complexity O(log n)).
The enhancement performed allows a user to create a custom course from the menu options as well as delete a course
from the Binary Search Tree list.

## ENHANCEMENT TWO
This enhancement takes the Binary Search Tree one step further. The added user functionality could
destabilize the tree (making it unbalanced, or "heavy"), degrading the search time complexity from 
O(log n) to O(n). Creating self-balancing algorithms helps maintain the search time complexity at O(log n)
while deletes and inserts are being performed.
