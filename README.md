## CS-499 Computer Science Capstone Project SNHU
Capstone Project for Southern New Hampshire University (CS-499)<br>
This project involved performing 3 enhancements from learned materials at SNHU onto 2 previous projects (artifacts). <br><br>

Artifact 1: Binary Search Tree <br>
Enhancements: (1). Add user functionality to add and delete courses into a binary search tree.<br>
(2). Convert the tree to a self-balancing tree to preserve search times.<br><br>

Artifact 2: Animal Shelter Dashboard <br>
Enhancements: Convert the dashboard database from MongoDB to SQLite (local database).<br>

## CS-465 Full Stack Development

A full stack web application built using MEAN (Mongo DB, Express, Angular, and Node.js). It provides a front-end user interface connected to a backend administrator dashboard that allows CRUD operations for a trip destination website called Travler. Focus of the project was on backend development (CRUD operations, authentication/authorization, and database exploration tools such as MongoDB Compass and Postman).
